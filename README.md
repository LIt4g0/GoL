Hello world! (Robert)

This project was part of the Yrgo Game Programmer(24) education. The challenge was to make a version of Conways Game of Life in Unity. I had approximately 2 1/2 weeks to do it. I believe the core functionality of Game of Life was working fine after two or three days. This can probably be seen by going back in the git history as the project has been on git since the very start. Since then I have spent a ton of time adding stupid and fun functionality and also refactoring the code and optimizing a lot of the functions. I hade a lot of fun adding colors and different spawns to the game. Even though this is more of a simulation than a game; I believe it was slightly gamified by the different spawns, colors and parameters that I implemented. Some came from random ideas while others were inspired from other class mates version of the game. All in all a very fun project.

To play you can either download the entire unity solution and open it in the Unity 2022.3.xx or you can download the .7z file which can be found in builds folder in the repository.

Controls:
Mouse to navigate menu.
Left mouse ressurect dead cells, right click to spawn patterns of cells.
You can click outside of the border, to the right or above the grid to increase the size up to 1000x1000. Performance tanks at around 350*350 though.
Middle mouse scroll to zoom, middle mouse to pan.
Space to pause/play.
